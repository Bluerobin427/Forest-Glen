Owner of [[Smith's Imports and Exports]] in [[Stronghurst]]. He's a very savvy businessman who does not like being lied to. 

On [[2022-6-25]] we tried to lie to him while turning in a quest. We ended up following up on the deal we set and got an "honesty reward." Probably ok to do more missions for him, but his business does trade in slaves. He said they're a small part of his business, so if we make it worth his time we MIGHT be able to get him to not do that.

Set up a deal you like before you accept the contract.

Has [[Adam Smith's private security force]] that has a symbol that looks like a bastardized version of [[Ivan the Destroyer]]'s.
