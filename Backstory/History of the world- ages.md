1.  **The Time of Formation:** Old Gods make the planet.

2.  **The Age of the Old Gods:** Gods and sentient beings share the same world.  Not much is known about this time. Generally portrayed as a “Dark and Perilous Time” for mortals.

3.  **The Time of Disagreement:** To reign supreme of the world, the old gods Gilean, god of knowledge, Reorx, god of craft, and Hiddukel, god of lies and greed, imprison their fellows in the crucible; and to no one’s surprise, Hiddukel betrayed Gilean and Reorx at the last second. The surprising thing was that Hiddukel ended up imprisoning himself in the process.

4.  **The Age of the Mortals:** Gods now are only contacted through their divine followers (Clerics and Paladins). 1000 years of Chaos with kingdoms forming and falling in an ongoing cycle.

5.  **The War of Ascension:** The Liberators offer a way to end the constant chaos and grow into a powerful force dedicated to restoring the Old Gods to the world. An alliance of disparate groups form to oppose them. The future New Gods eventually lead the alliance’s armies to victory, but betray their factions and ascend to godhood. 

6.  **The Time of Remaking:** The New Gods remake the world into the domains each will rule.  Lots of people died in the war and many more in the remaking of the world.

7.  **The Golden Age of the New Gods:** 500 years of stagnant societies and occasional clashes between domains of the New Gods. But for the most part each domain is self contained. 

8.  **The Sunset Age:** 200 year period where the New Gods disappeared or were killed.

9.  **The Age of the Lost:** Current age. The Power structures are trying to maintain the status quo, but the lack of the New Gods to hold it together means that more and more people are going their own way. PCs were born 255 years into this age.
