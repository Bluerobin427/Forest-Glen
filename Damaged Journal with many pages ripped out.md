[Not too long after Brom’s falling out with Gigakus Rex, she was approached by Ernesto Zabian. Ernesto has been obsessed with eternal life for as long as Brom knew him. Ernesto explained he was pursuing several different methods to ensure his immortality. Apparently, Ernesto was not convinced that he had achieved immortality through the Crucible's power. Ernesto wanted Brom to help him make a crystal that could store a copy of a soul. Unlike a phylactery, this should be able to store a copy of the soul, not just store the original, as his soul was already in a phylactery. He wanted a way to store copies of his soul for safekeeping. After 100 years of work, she succeeded. Ernesto took the crystals and her notes on the process. As a reward, Ernesto provided Brom with her desire, her rival’s wife. Ernesto modified Nora the Emerald Flame’s husband’s relationship preferences so he left Nora. Morpheus Willowcowl, was an important person in Gigakus Rex’s inner circle and one of the people that got Brom exiled.]
