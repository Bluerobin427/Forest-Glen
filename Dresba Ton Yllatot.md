Dresba! Grew up in a traveling performance troupe. His parents were in charge of auditory and visual illusions. Eventually it grew repetitive and he wasn't allowed to leave the wagons. He decided to leave and DO the things the troupe were performing ABOUT. He traveled a lot, got in trouble occasionally, made some questionable decisions, found drugs, realized travel can be painful and dangerous. Eventually he decided walking the roads was his thing, rather than the wilderness. He eventually came upon the twin towns. He didn't originally think much of them. Didn't like them. He DID, though, hear about Petunia and decided to check it out. He stopped in, didn't think much of it, but stayed. Met Brunhilda. Stayed another day. Stayed another day. Kept talking to Brunhilda. The rumor is that they're an item, but there's no observable evidence. They ARE professionally attached at the hip. He's shown some interest in Cradle. He used to leave town relatively often, but since we arrived he hasn't left much. Lots of people to train.

Questions for Dresba:

Any treasures you heard about be haven't had a chance to investigate? Yes. Lots. Ask him about places where we go. Local? Ask Urgot.

What's your favorite place you've been? Here, I guess. The only place I haven't left. Ruins of cities that Gigakus Rex built and rebuilt. Really nice pools with glowing lights, water fairies. Well west.

Have you left Gigakus's domain? NO! You can't leave! Well, you hear stories, but never actually found evidence of it.

Is the slavery we see here widespread? It crops up here and there. It was a focused experiment by Gigakus. He also played with pure equality. And the full spectrum. There was one town where they can only wear red. It was amazing! So many shades of red.

Are there bigger, more populated areas? Yes. This is the ass end of the Free Cities. The cities on the coast are the biggest ones, they get bigger as you follow the rivers.

Parents names? Troupe? Travel location? They traveled mostly up the main river, went to Frontier once. They stayed more towards the south. His parents were Dalmus and Finola. They found it was best to change their name occasionally so they appeared new... sometimes. They like to do the play that makes Gigakus look like a fool. Their wagon coverings are multicolored patchwork quilty.
