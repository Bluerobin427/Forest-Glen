# Forest Glen

Pig farmer. Usually dirty, covered in mud. Goes into the forest with them, looking for mushrooms to trade... or imbibe. Odd bird, Short, stodgy, talks to animals.

**Remember that one time?**

-   _Luigi_: Remember when we saw old lady Martha Markum doing the nude morning ritual. Didn’t we put fire ants under her mat?

_Meg_: Thought we had let the goat loose and it joined in. It was not ants. _Forest_: I remember when old lady Markum found out and chased you two with a broom.

**Zorlack and Meg, tell me a time when you played a prank on Luigi and Forest.** 

-   They gaslighted Forest into believing it is the Nude Dawn not the New Dawn. Made Luigi witness it. Thus began the Nude Dawn.
