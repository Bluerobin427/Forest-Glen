Standing over a man who looked scared. Luigi was in control. It was Ernesto Zabian, begging for his life . He felt powerful. In his other visions there was anger. It this one disappointment and pity. And this one it felt like it was him.

Exact text:

You are standing in an opulent throne room. Guards line the walls. Before you kneeling before you, cloaked, pathetic, is the lich king Ernesto Zabian. “Please. I beg you. They are all gone. All of them. Help me restore what was.”  

A deep voice, your voice “You sowed this harvest. Are your lands and people not made in your image?”

Ernesto Zabian: Sadly pleading “Please, I have nothing no one. You all have everything because I stepped aside. You OWE ME!”

You: “Do not call your cowardice and your greed “beneficence”. As always, you destroy what you love. We owe you nothing.”
