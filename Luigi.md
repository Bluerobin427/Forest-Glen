Luigi, or "Russo" if you prefer, stands a respectful height for a Mountain Dwarf. While his stature isn't what most would call majestic, the bulk of his arms and the girth of his magnificent mustache make up for the rather...portly stomach that hangs over a thick black leather Dwarven belt. Peaking out from under the stomach is a steel belt buckle adorned with Dwarven runes for dexterity and wisdom - of which Luigi has neither.

Luigi's face is handsome enough for a dwarf, with a quaffed mop of jet black hair rising like a wave on top of his head. Contrasting with his careful follicular stylings is the...rest. Cobbled together clothing stained crusty white with sweat and dark from wood varnish and polish. A sight to be seen, for sure.

He's a dwarf, puts himself together... except his gear. He tries! Really.
