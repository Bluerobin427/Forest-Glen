# Session 2: To the Guilds

Heading south out of town. Find a deer trail heading south. Luigi grabs a stick to use as a club. Zorlack looks for food. The farther south we get, the broader the trail gets - signs of occasional use.

As that happens, we come across an open area with trees and bushes lining the path in this area specifically. The plants look a little weird... some movement? Zorlack realizes that these aren't native bushes. Luigi slings one... Initiative! Ranged attacks plink away, Zorlack smashes one with his club! We kill the rest. Zorlack: "They were amBUSHES! Get it?! Ha ha!"

In Shrubby, Meg finds a black cloth band with a white tree with 6 roots stitched into it. Overlaid is a bloody dagger. The tree is a dead match for the tattoos that the New Dawn adults wear. There's apparently a rival group to the New Dawn with this dagger logo.

In Brambly, Forest finds all of its thorns. 1 damage. Zorlack recognizes they aren't normal shrubs, again. He also remembers a bit about how some individuals with magic could awaken plants. This could be that. He also finds a bunch of thorns. Ouch.

Luigi found a lot of leaves, sticks, and dirt in Bushy.

At the end of the day we set up camp. Sleep is normal. The next day, we continue on, skeptical of bushes. We smell pork! We find a spot where there's spatters of blood leading up to a tree. Luigi tries to sling the tree. Miss. Meg yells to see if anyone's there. "I could use some help! It's dead, I got the bastard." a woman lying up against the tree clutching her side, with a smoldering boar 10 ft in front of her. Meg tries to medicine her, "Oh you have a hole in your side!" wait, who are you? We do a bad job convincing her we're friends, but Zorlack gives her a healing potion. Her name is Alyne Foxtoes. She hasn't seen our twins. She's a Warden apparently. She was already kicked out of a proje- uh. Getting sent home, gored by a boar. Can we keep this between us? We try to draft a story of how this could be good, but decides it's not worth it.

Zorlack: What was your mission? Where were you coming from?

Alyne: Can't tell you. I was kicked off the mission, but it was a Warden mission.

We pump her for some info about guilds, towns, and the the dagger symbol. She doesn't know the symbol, but recognizes the tree. Doesn't know about Cradle. She says there's dicks in both guilds, but the Devourers give her the creeps. Always waiting for someone to stab you in the back. They do whatever they want, whenever they want.

Do the guilds have symbols?

Wardens: A castle, representing strength, solidity, renown. Will take anyone who builds up renown and pays the entrance fee (~10gp maybe?)

Devourers: An open book with a battleaxe superimposed, representing magic and might. To join: beat someone up. And pay them (~25gp each)

Do people join the guild from their town? Maybe. Might be more about where they grew up and how the towns are run. Stronghurst is more of a meritocracy, We talk for probably too long.

We continue on until we get to the twin towns. In the slums of Biggsville... it's bad. Hovels worse than Forest's pigsties. Ragged fields of wheat and barley. The people don't look up as we walk by. We try to give them pork. They're skittish and run off. Those without power are at the mercy of those with power. We try to give them pork.

We get to the walls of Biggsville. They're checking for documentation that we're supposed to be there. Alyne vouches for us and gets us through. Through the gate is a whole new world. Huge houses, manicured landscaping. Varied architecture, where everyone is trying to outdo everyone else. Plenty of serfs from outside the wall, wearing unified outfits, heads down.

We head into Stronghurst. They check us again. They aren't checking people going from Stronghurst to Biggsville. They're a little hoity-toity. Middle class and upper class, everyone is expected to work. We go to the Wardens' headquarters. "Forward to Glory" carved into the arch on the way in. The guards ask Alyne about her business. She's told to report to her commanders.

The guards tell us to go away until we've made something of ourselves. Random townspeople tell us about a job board and Orlof's Projectiles. We check out the job board: mostly hard labor, some slave catching, two bandit jobs (one "Southwest of town"). We decide to go to Orlof's, then to the town hall to check out the bandit job and see if it's Petunia.

We go to Orlof's. Luigi trades his Navigator's Pack for 12.5g worth of stuff (two handaxes for him, 10 shots each for Meg and Forest, and a javelin for Zorlack). Orlof's always wanted to sail the six seas...... Then we head off to the town hall to meet with the sheriff about the bandit job. Turns out we're meeting with the deputy. Deputy Rob.

We ask him about the job. He hands us a piece of paper. Two bandits, both found south and west. One name is unknown, operating between here and the couple of houses on the river down there. They kill everyone, higher reward (15g/bandit). The other one is a bandit leader named Wej Isronu. They've been hitting up caravans, but no one has died (10g/bandit).

We leave town, heading to Petunia. Mostly stopped taking notes here.

I'm so happy to be here!

Wait... you came here intentionally?

Buttercup is the mayor. Brunhilda owns the inn... maybe runs the "guild?" We talk to her.

Dresba will be in charge of your training.
