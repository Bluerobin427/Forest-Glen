# Session 3

We get pointed to [[Dresba]], a well-dressed man at the bar. He's the keeper of the ascot of class - he takes it off and offers it. Zorlack, Forest, and Meg try it out. Barbarian, Bard, and Fighter.

Munrab "Animal Master" Yaliab brought a menagerie to the twin towns. Lost all his money trying to impress [[Jaina]]. He lost his money to [[Brunhilda]]. Ha. Instead of getting a hold of the menagerie, he sold them to the Devourers and ran off.

He learned a lesson quick, you can't run from Brunhilda.

As we know, [[Ergnot Rain]] is in love with Jaina and tried to steal the animals and failed. He snuck into the zoo and got bit by a tiger, screamed, and ran out before guards caught him. The good news is that he grabbed a shirt to bind his wounds and grabbed a key with it, by accident. They think the key is for the cages.

Goal: Infiltrate the zoo, rescue the animals, and bring them to Jaina.

They've been monitoring the zoo for a while. After Ergnot's breaking they increased security, but recently the number of guards dropped considerably.

We go! [[Zabadu]] fills us in: The menagerie is to the west. Just south is a guard barracks with support. Don't go there. At least 3 guards, two of them are patrolling, one is sleeping.
