# Session 1: Rumspringa Festival!

There's a yearly festival for the new gods. This is the first time children have been kicked out for the festival... and we've been kicked out, along with our siblings. We need to get experiences outside the town. Get knowledge and experience and bring it back! Make us stronger!

Rumspringa! Lots of events! Today's the day. Our lives have built to this. Hours of competitions, then celebrations, and at the end of the day we leave and don't come back until we REALLY make a name for ourselves (~level 10). The town has some level 15s, they want to know we're worthy before we're welcomed back.

### **Competitions!**

**Can You Eat This?!** Nature checks to see if we can eat something. **Zorlack wins!** Meg and Forest Glen tiebreaker of "Can you eat Trumpfruit?!" Forest Glen "No you can't. Sick and Despair!"

Zorlack gets +1 to Nature (already had proficiency). Forest Glen gets proficiency in Nature.

**Donkey Wrangling!** Animal Handling. Forest Glen and Luigi participate! As well as Braedyn (Forest Glen's twin), Rene (twin of the one from our group who died, Ragnak).

Forest Glen wins by a landslide (+1 animal handling), Luigi (proficiency in animal handling) edges out over Braedyn. Woo!

**Steeplechase!** Perception! Zorlack, Forest Glen, Braedyn, and Rene! We get double checked to see if we're cheating. No cheats!

Rene wins, Zorlack 2nd.

**Recount the War of the Lich!** History checks! Luigi, Meg, Rene, and Alys!

Rene won! Meg got second.

**Truth or a Lie!** Deception checks! Zorlack, Carmen, Wautner. Can the judges tell if we're telling the truth or lying? Carmen lied about understanding others.

Carmen wins! Tie between Zorlack and Wautner! Zorlack second!

**The Most Dangerous Game!** Insight checks! Should we pet the cat Mr. Snicklefritz? No! Stinky? Apparently not! Miss Cuddlebums? yes! but only if you're good.

Forest Glen wins! Rene 2nd.

**Greased Pig Wrestling!** Athletics!

Luigi first, Alys second.

**Angry Goat Staring Contest!** Intimidation! Verna, Meg, Alys, and Luigi!

Meg first, Verna second!

**Puzzle Box!** Investigation! Meg, Carmen, Wautner

Meg first! Carmen second!

**Have I Got a Deal for You!** Persuasion! Luigi, Braedyn, Alys

Luigi 1st, Braedyn 2nd

After everything the adults coordinate a celebration! Everyone's excited to kick people out of town, we're the first ones! Everyone gets kits or tools! Clubs and daggers, slings and shortbows. We track ammo until we get somewhere where they'll sell/provide it.

Claire brings everyone together. The world is your oyster. Go find your future and return when you learn a bunch. "Seeking the help of a guild would make your beginning steps much easier." Two towns and two guilds... "THREE TOWNS AND THREE GUILDS!"

The Wardens in Stronghurst

Seek fame above all else. Renown as it were. The elite of the two guilds., they're choosier. More rigid, but the average Warden is of a higher caliber. Put the guild first.

The Devourers in Biggsville

A guild that has numerous individuals seeking power above all else. Will do everything they can to help you be stronger. Not many scruples.

... and a random collection of drunkards in an open dirt patch called Petunia.

Barely a guild. Haven't earned a name. Will take anybody. Drink more than anything else.

What dangers do we need to look for?

Wolves? Boars? Maybe bandits? Looks over to Edmund Wolfcrippler. "Random wandering monsters, too, but they do a sweep around Cradle to take out the bigger stuff. Should be ok."

Anyone with notes leftover can still use them (d4 on a skill check). Everyone gets a Potion of Healing (2d4+2).

We head with the goal of collecting experience to bring back! Probably going to Petunia.
