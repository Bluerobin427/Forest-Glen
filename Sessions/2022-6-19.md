We introduce Atka to Brunhilda. She gets Atka settled in.

		-Businesses
		-Guild Annex for training
And some things that are guild related:
	-Train T'Talck, Droom, Alice, Winnifred
	-Received applications to join the guild, would like someone with a discerning eye to vet them.
		Wants loyalty and ability to help

Also on the docket:
	-Cornhusking
	-Turn in mage tower quest
	-Abbey beer quest

Luigi goes to husk corn. Ettin Jameson greets Luigi and asks how he is doing. You notice she has a rope belt on and with a giant makeshift belt buckle with a polished chunk of copper in the center (that Luigi gave her). He regales her with a story of the tower. "You're so much cooler than my real brother."

He continues on, and takes 6.5 hours to harvest and shuck 1000 ears of corn.

Zorlack goes to see where T'talck and the rest are with training. Ends up getting sucked into training them in melee weapons+shields and staves until lunch.

We do [[Guild Interviews]].
