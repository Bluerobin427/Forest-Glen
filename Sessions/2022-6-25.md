Monday we did the tasks, Tuesday morning we did the guild interviews.

To do:
	-Turn in power crystal quest to [[Adam Smith]]'s trading depot
	-Take corn husks to a dwarf [[Reinhold Ironsword]] the Quaint Rest
	-Old abbey (brewing recipe?)
	-Training
	-Town help

We go to the towns to turn in quests.

Luigi goes into the Quaint Rest, finds [[Reinhold Ironsword]], orders beers. Reinhold is passed out and very fragrant. He takes the beer and drinks it. "I was supposed to deliver corn husks to you?" "BWUH? CORN HUSKS?" "Yes, a lot of them." He sweeps Luigi up in a hug, "Just like my dreams said would happen!" Dark, creepy with voices? Yup. Reinhold heads past Luigi out the door in pursuit of corn husks. He grabs them and leaves. Luigi looks around and puts his hand on the scepter. No feelings from the scepter, but he feels like he's accomplished something. "Ok then, let's go turn in the quest."

We go to [[Smith's Imports and Exports]].

[[Private Firearrow]] and [[Corporal Crushingbolt]] guard the front door. "Ha ha! The adventurers return! How did it go?" We tell them a little more than maybe we should have about how it went and what we found out. Then we are led through the compound by [[Rudiger]] to go meet with [[Adam Smith]]. It's busier than last time. More people around. Two main types: employees of the import/export company, look clean and orderly; types wearing smocks, dirtier, disheveled, clearly serfs. Most of the serfs/slaves seem to have a [[slave brand]] on their body: "QW." Luigi knows that often slaveowners mark them in some way. Also sometime people get marked for theft, etc. [[Rudiger]] tells us they've been importing and exporting a lot more than before. Lots of stuff to import and export. Maybe Petunia can get in on some importing and/or exporting. If we set up a deal, make sure to let Adam Smith know that [[Rudiger]] helped. We chose to keep the Launcher crystal (Evocation) and hand over the rest.

We wait in the conference room for 5 minutes or so, [[Rudiger]] comes back with tea and fruit scones. Then an excited dwarf and a sneering halfling enter. Two captains, in the uniform of the import/export company, also maybe associated with Ivan the Destroyer? One of [[Smith's Imports and Exports]] logos is a modified version of [[Ivan the Destroyer]]'s symbol: An army backed by a giant wielding a bow and a crossbow instead of the standard axe and sword. Female dwarf: "Ah the adventurer's have returned!" Quickly dismisses Forrest and Zorlack, sneers at Meg, and smirks at Luigi. They're not very nice overall? "You'll be able to talk to the boss soon! We were sent ahead to see how it went."

Zorlack asks about the extra people. "More importing and exporting!" What are you importing and exporting? Anything and everything. Are you selling people? Yes, only the ones already enslaved. Female dwarf [[Captain Firecowl]] and male halfling [[Captain Duskchuckle]] do a weird interrogation of us about how it went and what are strategies are. We give them some crumbs and say they're being weird. 

Frosty conversation with [[Adam Smith]]. We try to lie about how many crystals we found. He calls the bluff, we ask about the captains and the [[Devourers]]. He says they haven't dealt with the Devourers that he knows of, and the extra serfs are a client's who came to pick up a shipment. They don't sell many slaves. We end up giving over all 6 crystals and get a 500 gold bonus for being honest. Get 3500 gold. 

We go to the library. Old man at the front is deaf and mean. We find [[Kaukon Hairchewer]], the tiefling who helped us find the tower. We tell him about it and [[Atka Wilson]]. He'd like to meet her. Records of births and deaths are kept at the temple of [[Gigakus Rex]]. The [[Abbey of Glorious Ascension]] is on our map now. They were known for brewing alcohol from various things and throwing celebrations that could last for over a month. [[Gigakus Rex]] often attended and was very pleased with their work. One of the stories of how the Abbey fell was that [[Gigakus Rex]] was so pleased that he gifted wings to them, they flew too close to the sun, and they died. Many other stories about how the abbey fell. He'd like us to come tell him about the abbey once we find it. 

We go to buy some horses, carts, and supplies (6 draft horses (with bit, bridles, and saddles), 4 carts, 25 chickens, 15 sheep, and 10 pigs, plus 37.5 gold of bulk food and drink, spending 500 gold) and head back to [[Petunia]]. Get back in time for group meal and new member introductions. Luigi delivers shoes and a belt to Ettin's family.
