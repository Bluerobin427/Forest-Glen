We won! 16 vampire spawn got away, the druid got away. Killed everything else. We loot the bodies. On the greatsword one: 

Lieutenant Skellin, Take your squad and the QW thralls and attack from the northwest. Approach by stealth until you reach the inn or are discovered. Then kill everyone and burn everything. We’ve slipped the leash of that bitch, so we can now show Petunia’s so-called guild the price of crossing us. Captain, Kavetru Ela

On an archer:

Goggles of Night: are magical goggles that allow the wearer to see in the dark. A creature that wears them gains darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If the creature already has darkvision, the goggles instead increase the range of its darkvision by 60 feet. The base of the goggles is a soft cared-for cured leather, and the glass lenses have a bluish-purple sheen. The goggles can be comfortably placed over the head.

We get the remaining loot over chat later:


We get a message from Brunhilde:
50 armed enforcers about 2 hours out. Hurry back, we could use you. Will try to guerilla harrass to slow them down.
Forest responds:
Thought this was Jaina's line! 16 vampire spawn escaped, we killed the rest. On our way back.

On the way back, we find 9 spawn in a pack and take them out in a quick combat. We'll make it back in 1.5-2 hours. Rolled a 9 on a d10 to see how well the guerilla delaying worked.
