It's the morning of Wednesday, day 249. Luigi finds a piece of cloth in his pocket that says, "L.R.  Connection is a power." Luigi Russo, Lia Russo. Also a [[7 root, one black, tree symbol]]. 

Forest goes to do his morning ritual. We have an existential crisis that we were the ones who tricked him into doing this every morning. Ref--> [[Forest Glen]]

Luigi comes to Meg and Zorlack in his sleeping clothes. He had another vision. [[Luigi's vision]] We comfort him a bit. 

To Do:
The Abbey quest
Get Atka settled
Build things for the town
Build things for the guild
Recruit people to town

Luigi asks [[Enor]] to do some research on fights between  [[the new gods]]. It's not a rush if she has other things to do. Meg asks if she can help with the book on Mayhem Marguerite as well.

Zorlack goes to see if he can recruit [[Gerda Hildedotr]] as a town scout. He pays for the first 15 days (2 gold per day), Brunhilde is convinced and will pay after that. Zorlack introduces Gerda to [[Urgot Rain]] to get the basics of what to do and who/what to kill. 

Meg and Zorlack go to recruit [[Umur]] as town potter. Agree to pay him 200g for setup fees that he pays back over 5 years. He'll get the shop built for free as the other merchants have. They then go to recruit [[Elfthryth Titanhood]] as a fighter instructor. She agrees, 2g per day, we have to let her know after a year whether she can join the [[Guild]] as an official instructor.

Forest goes to Bullywog and lets him know about Atka. Says go say hi, then peaces out. Then he goes to teach [[T'talck]] about love and how to get a woman to love him. "You gotta just let these things happen. If it doesn't happen, it's not in the cards." He then teaches T'talck about the birds and the bees... after having done it once. Except with pig metaphors. T'talck is both horrified and aroused. He ends up leaving despondant and confused at not having great romance advice.

Luigi leaves a note for his Potion of Animal Friendship to go to Ettin to "find a new best friend" if he dies. He then spends the morning carpenting. Mostly decorative "welcome home" over the doorway stuff.

Guild lunch!

After lunch, Zorlack goes to check in with Zoey. She's working on scaling up production. She's also working on pig wine. Forest comes to help out with that as well. He advocates for marketing as well. Zorlack thinks about finding food pairings and we go to the guild hall to talk to [[Coreopsis Clive]]. Coreopsis has passed a lot of the cooking on to El. We talk to Coreopsis. He's weirdly excited? He's not a huge fan. "There's a lot of flavors going on." "Well, I'm honored that you let me try some." Most of the time while he's talking he's looking at Forest's crotch. Right. He didn't mind watching Forest's morning ritual.

Luigi goes to wash his clothes, then helps chop some trees.

Meg helps with thatching.

Zorlack checks in with Urgot before bed. He hasn't seen much movement north and northeast of Petunia. His people are looking northwest. Pretty quiet. 

We go to bed.

In the middle of the night. 10-11 o'clock we awake to shouting, "To arms! To arms!" Banging on doors. Forest pops out of his bed naked. It's Renee! "Forest! ... Forest you fucking moron, get people up. They're coming!" The enforcers are coming. Brunhilde brings Renee downstairs to ask more about what's doing on. We bring our stuff downstairs and start putting on our armor.

Luigi - "Asks if the guild will provide!"
Forest - "Pretty wild. Enforcers, haven't crossed swords with them yet."

B- How you you know? R- We've been tracking them. B- How much time do we have? R- Hours, maybe. B- Good. E- Tell me what's going on.

Renee- "Big ol' info dump."

The reinforcing serfs are the QW serfs. Great. 

50 enforcers and 50 serfs. The enforcers from the west, the serfs from the northwest.

Forest- "Any idea what they want?"" R- "They want to kill everyone. You should leave, the Devourers can protect you."
Zorlack- "Will the Devourer's help here?" R- "We are helping, and I'm not leaving Forest's side." She pulls him in for a kiss.

Brunhilde- We can't get the farmers across the river in easily. Going to take about half a day. 

We all decide to go slow down the serfs. Seth has overclocked the cannons. They have a 50/50 shot of exploding if we really push them.

Urgot- "There's a series of creeks with bridges just south of Biggsville. A good place to try and stop them." Brunhilde- "If you're set on doing this, do it fast and get back. I don't know if we could hold off 50 enforcers for long."

Liliana- "The guild will provide." 2 Greater Healing Potions, a scroll of Light, and ammo.

We leave town. Zorlack fumbles a Survival role at advantage. Two hours later.... fight at the creeks!
