While Mike is out for a bit, we go check out the [[Abbey of Glorious Ascension]]. We go past the new [[Temple of Mishikal]], continue along the road for a short time, then veer off the road to where we think the Abbey might be. Walking through an open prairie, wind rustling the grass and birds chirping. After about 3 hours, we see a region of the prairie that looks trampled. We decide to go check it out. Looks like a path made by a large number of humanoids carrying some weight. About a day old, heading west. We continue on.

We find the abbey! An outer wall around the compound, in the center a crumbled building with a big yew tree growing out of it. As we get closer, we hear talking. We sneak up a bit closer. Chatter, mostly high-pitched, talking about alcoholic beverages.

"YES! We have guests! Come, drink, and play!" We see 5 beings: a sprite, a pixie, dryad, satyr, and a brigganock, all lounging and drinking. "Come! Contestents! If you entertain, you get a prize, then we drink and dance!"

What did you come here for? We want brewing knowledge! Great!

My friends and I here would like some entertainment, but we are fair folk and we would gladly give a reward for entertainment. Would you like to participate?

Sure!

The sprite lost a bet, pays the pixie, thought we would refuse. So! Bold contestents! 'Fresh meat! Fresh meat!' 'Entertainment!'

"OK! The first game! You must provide a gift to the one of us, correct gifting wins." We think maybe "wan" or "juan" instead of "one"? 

The satyr would like a herring. The pixie would like a gold piece. The dryad would like a pinecone. The brigganock would like joyous memories. The sprite would like a dagger to stab us with.

We have a look around.
Zorlack finds:

Hard candy 1 sp
Zircon (transparent pale blue-green), Ã—2 (50 gp)
Partially used candle
Chrysoprase (translucent green) (50 gp)
Star rose quartz (translucent rosy stone with white star-shaped center) (50 gp)

Meg finds:

Silver chalice set with moonstones (750 gp)
Small gold idol (750 gp)
Obsidian statuette with gold fittings and inlay (750 gp)
Ceremonial electrum dagger with a black pearl in the pommel (750 gp)
Bottle stopper cork embossed with gold leaf and set with amethysts (750 gp)

Meg gives a gift to the brigganock who is the "wan" of them and wins!

Zorlack is physically closest after guessing how many fingers he's hold up.

Drink with us! The last dross standing wins. 

The first is Dryad's Tears. Salty, sweet, expands when it hits our stomach. Strength saves... We fail. Zorlack and Forest vomit rocks. Meg vomits wine. For about a minute. They step back and wait for it to end.

Next is Sprite Pee. Tiny cups. It tastes warm, salty, and a little bitter. Con saves. Forest and Zorlack make saves. Meg pees herself.

Third. Satyr's Love. He winks. It's warm and salty. Meg rolls poorly and starts making out with him.

Pixie Dust! We success saves.

Wishes Be Mined. Zorlack saves. Forest and Meg's minds are filled with desire and they whisper things they want for a minute:
Forest: Renee, a giant pinewood bonfire, smoking with Dresba, Brayden getting kicked in the nards, Brayden drinking these drinks... Brayden stuff
Meg: raccoon snuggletime, Verna liking her, shinies

Congratulations! You completed it! We laughed, we cried, we drank. Prizes! The loser prize: (/r d3: 1) Forest! You are the loser, congratulations! We provide you with this reward that you must wear to get the winner prize! A hat that looks and smells like a pine tree. He puts it on with a scowl. (/r d100: 97) It's cursed and he can't remove it for 97 hours. Congratulations loser! It looks very nice. Now time for the winner! (/r d3: 1) Forest! Congratulations! You both lost and won! We have this! The [[Abbey Recipe Book]]! Also, a leafy brew the satyr made in honor of this leafy place!

Tears of Disbelief and Death: Not As Great As You Thought, Eh Rexy?
85 lb. (2.2 kg) Great Western wheat malt
4.85 lb. Durst Pilsner malt
2.68 Hallertau pellet hops
Wild yeast
6 oz. Liberator tears (high quality Tears), dwarf tears (moderate quality Tears), sea salt (low quality Tears)

Liberator? We think it has something to do with the New Gods? Meg remembers an organization called the Liberators that the New Gods were associated with before ascending. [[History of the world- ages]]

IRL Drink break!

We describe our new rooms at the guild.

We ask the DM some questions: 
Are there population centers in the other regions? Yes except for Ernesto's.

What happens to souls here?
Souls go to normal soul places. Each god was the arbiter of life and death in their own domains. Now... it's unclear. 

Is there active animosity between old and new god worshipers?
In the Free Cities, when Gigakus was in charge, no old gods, only Gigakus was allowed to be worshipped. There was an underground group that would worship old gods anyway. After he left, worship of the old gods revived. Now, the old god worshippers are rare, but exist. Most people here worship Gigakus, but those that don't are expanding.
