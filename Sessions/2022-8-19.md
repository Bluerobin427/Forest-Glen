We kill some stuff from the first wave. The second wave shows up, gets fireballed and scorching ray'd. An arcane caster dies.

After the combat, we head to the center of town. 

[[Kaunos]], second in command of the Devourers is there.

Apparently, soon after the vampire spawn left town, Verna walked up and down the streets of Stronghurst yelling that the Devourers were attacking Petunia. We got a bunch of help. The deputies got "permission", Gavin Longgazer was worries and showed up. Aline showed up with her Warden people. T'Talck's parents showed up. The guards from Adam Smith came off duty. The Devourers came for Renee and Carmen, but did not help. 

Zorlack yells loudly in frustration about the Devourers not keeping the Enforcers on a leash. Brunhilde tries to calm him down diplomatically.

We managed to avoid casualties for the most part. 30% were injured. Only 4 people died. The vampire spawn got 3 of them. Two groups of enforcers got into town. Several buildings were destroyed.

Deathclaw killed an enforcer with firebreath! 
Lots of other updates I couldn't keep up with.

Lieutenant Slavecrusher, we've slipped the leash of that bitch, etc. Similar note to the one in [[2022-7-11]]

The next day, Brunhilde gathers the guild. Everyone is tired, Brunhilde more than most. 

You saved the town, lots of dead Enforcers. Killed the QW thralls. Hippogriff Zvert died. Mike didn't husk enough corn. There'll be a funeral for the four who died tomorrow. Arum and Alice have gotten most of the ones with minor injuries on their feet. Alice is at a table, sleeping during this meeting. The south and west parts of the town took a lot of damage, fires didn't destroy a lot, which is good. State of the outlying farms is unknown. 

She wants to split up town and guild responsibilities. Vote on a mayor. If you're elected, you take a break from the guild. 

She brought us here to discuss the rest of the enforcers.
Zorlack- How many more are there?
B- 20 at most? But probably the best of the best. 
Z- What's to stop the Devourer's 

Urgot's apparently the heir to the QW (Bullstorm) subfamily. QW stands for "Quintessential Warrior." He's surprised that they could be the backers because they were nobodies. What do we want to do next?

Leaning towards approaching the Wardens and figuring out what happened to them.
