We went to the Wardens, they were jerks, [[Alyne]] came and found us, took us to the [[Quaint Rest]] back room, and answered a bunch of questions. She and her group trying to figure out what's going on with her guild. Most of her guild have gone missing on missions, the leadership hasn't been seen in a while, things have gone missing around town, and the leadership of several Biggsville houses haven't been seen during the day. Alyne's group haven't been allowed back into the guild in a couple months, but they're still trying to figure out what's going on. We invite them to [[Petunia]].

Afterwards we go to the Enforcer HQ, accidentally threaten the guards, some run off, some run into the building. [[Luigi]] pops in through a window. Roll initiative!
