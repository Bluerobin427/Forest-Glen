[[Forrest]] tries the front door of the Enforcer's HQ. It's unlocked! We go in to a small foyer. He summons a raven in past the second set of doors, sees an entrance room With some desks, a blue crystal, a red crystal, a bubbling stone fountain, and some undead looking enemies, two of which look like vampire spawn and two "death knights." FIREBALL. 

The death knights hit like a truck. Zorlack can take one and a half hits. He takes two. The blue crystal flares to stop [[Forrest]]'s pig summon. Zorlack leaves. Meg grabs the blue crystal and leaves.

Turns out Roll20 messed with our character sheets, so Zorlack's actually healthier than expected. Everyone is!

We hear people yelling for help from further inside. We decide to fight?

Zorlack grabs the red crystal. Luigi looks through the next door. 5 enemies, one of which is Eomen from the [[Guild Interviews]]. 2 hostages, likely to be killed. 2 more red crystals, 2 more blue. Two banners on the wall, one Enforcers, one [[QW]]. He closes the door and leaves. 

We kill the two vampire spawn and one of the death knights. The other one tries to take us out as we leave. We escape and take out the last death knight. We leave the hostages, and run. Zorlack and Luigi head to the sheriff's in [[Stronghurst]] and Meg and Forrest go the New Gods' Temples to get T'talck's mom to ID the death knights.
