We race back to Petunia. Forest attunes to the wand as we go. We're greeted by Jaina, Droom, and Peony with armed townsfolk.

They get info from us about the 7 vampire spawn coming to attack. They send us to Brunhilde at the rock. We see Brunhilde with a crowd around a table, quiet. She sees us: "Thank the gods! All good? Anyone hurt?" We recount what happened, including that we got 9 of the 16 we let through.

"There's a lot to come, catch your breath as you can. Then-" A scream: "They've been sighted! They've been sighted!" Running up the road is a gangly, awkward tween boy: Snakeroot Jameson. Gibberishes at as. His mom is there and tells him to gather himself. "The tower spotted them, 10 minutes away." We get told to go help the main forces. Brunhilde shouts: "Dobra! Signal enemy sighted southeast. Everyone prepare for battle." 

She turns back, looking fearful but doing her best to hide it. She wants us to BE the main force, with two other guild members.

We get to the tower at the main force area. The skirmishers come to meet us. Carmen's with them!

Urgot asks what they should do. We tell them we'll take two of them and send the rest to Brunhilde. They go to their places in town. We choose two from:

Zaba Dew - Yes
Urgot Rain - Yes
Wej Isronu - not leveled
T'Talck Evilsbane - wounded
Mia Flkadfjlsdyosj Longstrider - not built for combat, really
Cronalia Fistwallop - no
